Ever since I was young, playing and composing music was a central focus in my life.  I remember the excitement of improvising a new song on the piano, and performing it for my parents and friends. The thrill of diving into the unknown, while reassured by the safety net of 'play,' is directly applicable to software development. 

Just as a band produces a song and collaborates to make it better and more polished, I look forward to becoming comfortable enough with programming languages to build something from scratch, share it with my community, and then put it out into the world to help others. 

Today I went to a coding meetup for the first time, a small gathering of nine.  I was struck by how passionate everyone talked about their projects, perspectives, and philosophy related to code.  Although I felt overwhelmed surrounded by people with much more expertise than myself, and a lot of the things they discussed were way over my head, I felt included and respected, and wasn't afraid to ask questions. 

I'm unsure yet of what I'll end up building with code, but I'm excited to be joining of a network of passionate creators - it feels like home.
