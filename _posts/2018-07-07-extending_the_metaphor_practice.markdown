As I dive deeper into the world of programming, I begin to see even more similarities between the practice of coding and the practice of music.  Last night, as I was driving home, I listened to a live broadcast of the William Tell Overture by Rossini.  The opening measures feature a beautiful cello solo, supported by the rest of the section in sweet harmony.  As a cellist myself, I was flooded with memories of performing and practicing that same solo.  I remember painstakingly working every measure for intonation and accuracy.  I remember recording  myself playing the solo, listening back for glitches in my playing.  Performing the thirty-two brief but beautiful measures for my teacher and getting their feedback, only to go back to the practice room and rework my ideas.

Practicing music is hard, gruelling work, but people do it because the end result is beautiful.  A piece of music brings people together, it changes them, transports them.  Music adds quality and laughter to our lives.  

As I reminisced about my musical trials and tribulations, I realized that the practice of music is similar to the practice of coding.  We write code to create something bigger than ourselves; to create something that will help others and make their lives easier.  Writing code, passing tests, and checking for errors can be tedious, time-consuming, and gruelling.  But we do it because we know that in the end, we will create something that is useful and maybe even beautiful to others.
