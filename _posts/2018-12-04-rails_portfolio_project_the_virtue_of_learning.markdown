Working through my third portfolio project, I find myself feeling like a sophomore, or by the classic Greek definition, 'a wise fool.'  Troubleshooting my errors and overcoming programming obstacles felt good, because I am realizing that I have learned a lot about programming in Ruby, and how to use Rails.  But at the same time, I am just now learning exactly how much I *don't know!*

Nevertheless, this project was infinitely gratifying.  Here are some things I learned along the way:

1. Refer frequently to the output of `rake routes` and be sure to pass in the proper arguments to your link helpers and form helpers

2. Reread the Rails Guides.  Over and over again until they make sense.

3. Debugging using the Rails console is often more strategic than simple error-driven development using the rails server.

4. PLACE STATIC ROUTES ABOVE DYNAMIC ROUTES.

5. Keep aiming for a minimally-viable product.  Although it's tempting to want to add many different features, start with the absolute essentials, make sure they are working properly, then refactor for improved readability and resilience.  After that, new features can be added if there is time.

6. If you can't get past an error, keep calm, take a break, and come back with fresh eyes!

I am so grateful for this learning experience and so excited to continue to grow my knowledge of Ruby on Rails and Bootstrap.
